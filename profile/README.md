## AIModels by VisionInit

AI Models will be the most secure way to download and work with AI Models.
We fit the role of 'pip' or 'npm' for AI models.

Install a model once, use everywhere. Save huge amounts of disk space.
Third party software wont need to manage independent code to download & install models.

<!-- ABOUT ME -->
## About me
I'm a self taught developer who started the journey with a Commodore Vic-20 back in the late 80's. I've been an advocate of free software and open source for many years, and have sought to bring those values into the contributions I provide. Some of the achievements I'm proud of:

- Fight For the Future awarded me the Nyan Cat Medal of Internet Freedom
- IT Service Management ITIL Certification
- Have earned thousands in bug bounties (Stanford Bug Bounty program, and others)
