## AIModels by VisionInit

AI Models will be the most secure way to download and work with AI Models.
We fit the role of 'pip' or 'npm' for AI models.

Install a model once, use everywhere. Save huge amounts of disk space.
Third party software wont need to manage independent code to download & install models.
